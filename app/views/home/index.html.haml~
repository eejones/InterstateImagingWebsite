  %p Interstate Imaging began operations in 1978, as an offshoot of a local hospital in Evansville, IN.  However, we had the same sole owner since 1989.  Our firm is a shareholder of National Health Distributors (NHD); this provides access to all major GPO contracts. Our coverage area encompasses Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois, Missouri, Ohio (Cincinnati area), and Tennessee (Nashville area).
